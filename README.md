# Why I made this repo

This project is used by `me` to learn C# WPF development. The plan for a final product is to make a local client for my school's post application. Over the time the repo's name might change to smth like CshProj and contain much more solutions.

## Goals

 - learn C# WPF just enought to design simple UIs
 - learn C# web programming just enough to work with the API provided by my school
 - learn .NET GitHub CI/CD
 - learn how to deliver .NET WPF application code
 - make the post management application
